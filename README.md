### a. Signed Contribution Agreement

*TODO: Link to image of signed table*

### b. Links:

*TODO Live url of your project (if any), repository url (github/bitbucket/google drive) of your source code (if any), public dataset links of your project (if any).*

### c. Summary: 

*TODO The objective/purpose of your project.*

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a highly scalable, distributed web application for the general public to better understand the status of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Objectives

*TODO*

The web application will... | ...so that...
------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------  
Utilise the [AWS public data lake for analysis of COVID-19](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/blogs/big-data/a-public-data-lake-for-analysis-of-covid-19-data/?fbclid=IwAR1XVPlWxg8G-a3TR7rJkwkvJFXFyAtT9e6vSvl8J5B-KsQPUg_aff4T8IE) as it's data source | data for the application will remain free, up-to-date and seeded from various reputable sources.[1](###-i-References)
Be highly scalable *(needs to be more granular)* | it can accomodate for growth and will be easier to maintain
Comprise of a distributed architecture | bottlenecks and incapacity to scale are avoided. [2](###-i-References)
Present the data in an easy to digest dashboard | users can quickly ascertain an understanding of their requested data.
Utilise data analysis tools |  users can specify their inputs to meet their requirements.
