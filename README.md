### c. Summary: 

*IN PROGRESS*

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a highly scalable, distributed web application for the general public to better understand the status of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Objectives

The web application will... | ...so that...
------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------  
utilise the [AWS public data lake for analysis of COVID-19](https://aws.amazon.com/ko/blogs/big-data/a-public-data-lake-for-analysis-of-covid-19-data/?fbclid=IwAR1XVPlWxg8G-a3TR7rJkwkvJFXFyAtT9e6vSvl8J5B-KsQPUg_aff4T8IE) as it's data source | data for the application will remain free, up-to-date and seeded from various reputable sources.[[1]](###-i-References)
be highly scalable *(needs to be more granular)* | it can accomodate for growth and will be easier to maintain
comprise of a distributed architecture | bottlenecks and incapacity to scale are avoided. [[2]](###-i-References)
present the data in an easy to digest dashboard | users can quickly ascertain an understanding of their requested data.
utilise data analysis tools |  users can specify their inputs to meet their requirements.
monitor health | any disruptions to service or security risks can be identified early and potentially averted.
allows users to specify requirements | *provide valuable information*

### d. Introduction: 

*IN PROGRESS* 

#### i. What are the motivations behind your idea?

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundementally changed the lives of the global population.

#### ii. What it does?

The application provides a convenient dashboard interface that allows users to view the status of COVID-19 cases in the USA as well as globally. The application will allow users to specify input based on location/number of deaths/number of recoveries/number of new cases.

#### iii. Why it is required?

- Rather than having to seek out this information on the web, users have access to up-to-date, easy to read and unbiased statistics without the sensationalisation of any news outlets. 
- Users can get information specific to where they live
- Facilitates an understanding on why social distancing laws are required and the effects this has on transmission, number of cases, pressure on medical system etc.


#### iv. How it can be used as real-life application?

User case scenario:

- User feels overwhelmed with amount of information presented by news channels
- User wants the statistics, with no bias. User wants this to be easy to understand.
- User downloads the app and checks out global cases - she sees that new cases globally have gone down in the last month.
- This gives user peace of mind and encouragement in regards to social distancing.

#### v. The advantages/positive/new things of your application.

Advantage | Benefit
----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------
Complexity removed | Users can easily define their requirements which will be presented in a simple dashboard
Up-to-date data from numerous sources | Users can know that what they are seeing is current and the result of not just one source.
Unbiased and non-sensationalised | No news corporations driving fear into viewers for financial gain. Facts and numbers only.
Template for any future pandemics | An app like this would be very useful for future pandemics - particularly in the early stages when an informed population can appropriately take measures to contain contamination.
